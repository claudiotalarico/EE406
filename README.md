### Required EDA software
1. Open the PowerShell and install WSL<br>
`wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04`<br>
You will be prompted to create a UNIX username and password.<br>
This UNIX username and password have no relationship to your Windows username and password.<br>
To avoid any confusion use a different username
2. [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)<br>
3. Start Ubuntu (either by typing `wsl` into the Windows's PowerShell or selecting the Ubuntu app in the Window's Start Menu) <br>
Your unix user's home directory is:<br>
`/home/<unix username>`<br>
Your Windows user's home directory is:<br>
`/mnt/c/Users/<windows username>`
5. clone the [iic-osic-tools](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS) container onto your computer (for example into your Windows user's folder)<br>
`git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools.git`<br>
*Example*<br>
Windows user's folder: `C:\Users\claudio`<br>
In Unix, the Windows user's folder is accessible as:
`/mnt/c/Users/claudio`<br>
5. Start Docker Desktop
6. Browse to the iic-osic-tools directory<br>
`cd /mnt/c/Users/claudio/iic-osic-tools`<br>
7. Start the container using the script `./start_x.sh`<br>
**NOTE:** in the script, all user data is persistently mounted in the directory pointed to by the environment variable `DESIGNS` <br>
The default is `$HOME/eda/designs`<br>
To change where the user data is mounted edit the `./start_x.sh` script and modify the definition of the variable `DESIGNS`<br><br>
*Example*<br>
On Windows: <br>
`DESIGNS="/mnt/g/My Drive/eda/designs"`<br>
or alternatively create a link:<br>
`ln -s /mnt/g/My\ Drive/ ghome`<br>
and then define the variable `DESIGNS` as follows:<br>
`DESIGNS=$HOME/ghome/eda/designs` <br><br>
On Mac:<br>
`DESIGNS="$HOME/Google Drive/My Drive/eda/designs"`<br>
or<br>
`DESIGNS=$HOME/Google\ Drive/My\ Drive/eda/designs`<br><br>
If needed set also the variable `DISPLAY`<br>
*Example*<br>
`PARAMS="${PARAMS} -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0"`

9. In the unfortunate event that .Xauthority does not exist in the user home directory, it will show the below error:<br>
   ```
   xauth
   xauth:  file /root/.Xauthority does not exist
   Using authority file /root/.Xauthority
   ```
   Below are the steps to manually create .Xauthority under the user home directory:<br>
   ```
   touch ~/.Xauthority
   # Generate the magic cookie with 128 bit hex encoding
   xauth add ${HOST}:0 . $(xxd -l 16 -p /dev/urandom)
   # Verify the result and it shouldn't show any error
   xauth list
   ```

10. If everything goes as it should, you will see a terminal with the prompt `/foss/designs >` <br>
This is your working directory where all your design data goes.<br>
If you are curious to see what version of the iic osic tools you are running use the command: <br>
`echo $IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_VERSION`

11. The default PDK is the `sky130A`. However, the container supports also other PDKs.<br>
    The available PDKs are:<br>
    ```
    gf180mcuC
    gf180mcuD
    ihp-sg13g2
    sky130A
    ```
    If you want to switch to the IHP PDK type:<br>
    ```
    iic-pdk ihp-sg13g2
    ``` 
    To skip typing this command every time, create a `.designinit` text file in your design directory with the following lines:
    ```
    echo $IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_VERSION
    export PDK=sky130A
    export PDKPATH=$PDK_ROOT/$PDK
    export STD_CELL_LIBRARY=sky130_fd_sc_hd
    export KLAYOUT_PATH=$PDKPATH/libs.tech/klayout:$PDKPATH/libs.tech/klayout/tech
    echo PDK=$PDK
    echo PDKPATH=$PDKPATH
    echo STD_CELL_LIBRARY=$STD_CELL_LIBRARY
    echo KLAYOUT_PATH=$KLAYOUT_PATH
    ```
    For more information about the ihp-sg13g2 technology lookup the [IHP github](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK)

12. If you have been using the iic osic tools for a while and all you want to do is to update to the newest version, pull the image with tag latest:<br>
    `docker pull hpretl/iic-osic-tools:latest` <br>
    and restart the container using the script:<br>
    `start_x.sh`<br>

    Don't forget to stop and remove containers that have become useless, and to remove images that have become useless.

13. In case you need to use an older image instead of the latest do the following:<br>
   ```
   export DOCKER_TAG=2024.12
   ./start_x.sh
   ```

    The `start_x.sh` script I am using is attached.
    
15. Following are a few CLI docker commands that may come handy:<br>
    ```
    docker ps -a
    docker ps -a --no-trunc
    docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>
    docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>
    docker image
    docker rmi <IMAGE_ID>
    docker inspect <IMAGE_ID>
    ```
    [Look at the docker documentation for more info](https://docs.docker.com/reference/)
