* Technology
The technology we will be using to design analog circuits with the gm/ID methodology is the IHP 130nm open PDK 
The target process is called sg13g2 and it is a high-performance BiCMOS technology with a 0.13 Î¼m CMOS process 
The MOS transistors we will use are the low-voltage (sg13_lv_nmos and sg13_lv_pmos)
The valid range of the models for these two devices are:
L = (0.13 - 10)um
W = (0.15 - 10)um
