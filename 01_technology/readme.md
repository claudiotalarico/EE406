## Technology
The technology we use to design analog circuits with the gm/ID methodology is the [IHP 130nm open PDK](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK)<br> 
The target process node (**sg13g2**) is a high-performance BiCMOS technology with a 0.13 Î¼m CMOS process<br><br>
The MOS transistors we use in EE406 are the low-voltage (sg13_lv_nmos and sg13_lv_pmos) <br>
The valid range of the models provided for these two devices are:<br>
L = (0.13 - 10)um<br>
W = (0.15 - 10)um<br>
