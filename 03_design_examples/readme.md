## $g_{m}/I_{D}$ Design Examples

The examples in this section are taken from Ch.3 (**Basic Sizing Using the gm/ID Methodology**) of <br>
Jesper's and Murmann's book [Systematic Design of Analog CMOS Circuits Using Pre-computed Lookup Tables](https://github.com/bmurmann/Book-on-gm-ID-design)<br>
The examples are "adapted" to use IHK sg13g2 technology.
