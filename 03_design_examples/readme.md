## $g_{m}/I_{D}$ Design Examples

The examples in this section are taken from Ch.3 (**Basic Sizing Using the gm/ID Methodology**) of <br>
Jesper's and Murmann's book: [Systematic Design of Analog CMOS Circuits Using Pre-computed Lookup Tables](https://github.com/bmurmann/Book-on-gm-ID-design)<br>
The examples are "adapted" to use the [IHP sg13g2 open-source PDK](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK)

|---|---|---|
| 3.1 pp. 67-69	| [01](https://github.com/claudiotalarico/EE406/blob/main/03_design_examples/examples/01_example.md) | sizing for given L and $g_{m}/I_{D}$  |  
| 3.2 pp. 70-73  |  [02](https://github.com/claudiotalarico/EE406/blob/main/03_design_examples/examples/02_example.md) | sizing at constant $g_{m}/I_{D}$ |
