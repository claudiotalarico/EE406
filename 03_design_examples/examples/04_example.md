## IGS: sizing at constant $|A_{V0}|$

Consider an IGS with $C_{L}$ = 1 pF and constant $|A_{V0}|$=25. <br>
Find combinations of $L$ and $g_{m}/I_{D}$ that 1) maximize unity gain frequency or 2) minimize current consumption<br>
and achieves at least 70% of the maximum unity gain frequency.

Sizing for constant $|A_{V0}|$ is common when designing operational amplifiers to be used in circuits for which we want<br>
a certain target feedback loop gain. <br>
