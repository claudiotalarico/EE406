## IGS: sizing at constant $g_{m}/I_{D}$  

Consider an IGS with $C_{L}$ = 1 pF and $g_{m}/I_{D}$=15 S/A. <br>
Find combinations of L, W and $I_{D}$ that achieve $f_{u}$=0.1 GHz and compute the corresponding DC gain ($A_{vo}$) <br> 
and fan-out (FO = $f_{T}/f_{u}$).

Sizing for constant $g_{m}/I_{D}$ is typical of circuits that are either limited by distortion (linearity places an <br> 
upper bound on $g_{m}/I_{D}$) or that operate at low voltage and require a large signal swing ( $g_{m}/I_{D}$ = 2 / $V_{Dsat}$ ). <br>
