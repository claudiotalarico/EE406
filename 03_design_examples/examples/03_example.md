## IGS: sizing at constant $f_{T}$

Consider an IGS with $C_{L}$ = 1 pF and $f_{T}$=1 GHz. <br>
Find combinations of $L$ and $g_{m}/I_{D}$ that 1) maximize DC gain or 2) minimize current consumption.<br>

Sizing for constant $f_{T}$ is common in the case of amplifiers for which we want to achieve a fixed gain-bandwidth product, 
or in the case of cascode configurations, where is useful to size the common-gate device such that the non-dominant pole is above some given frequency.<br>
