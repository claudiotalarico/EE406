## Sizing in weak inversion


In weak inversion $(g_{m}/I_{D})_{max})$ in nearly constant irrespective of $L$.<br>
Once the transistor enters weak inversion, $g_{m}/I_{D}$ no longer uniquely defines the drain current density.

In other words, a wide range of current densities map to nearly the same value of $g_{m}/I_{D}$, so $g_{m}/I_{D}$ is no longer a good proxy to design<br>
