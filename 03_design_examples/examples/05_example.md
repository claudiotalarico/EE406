## Sizing in weak inversion

In weak inversion $(g_{m}/I_{D})_{max})$ is nearly constant irrespective of L

Once the transistor enters weak inversion, $g_{m}/I_{D}$ no longer uniquely defines the drain current density. <br>
In other words, a wide range of current densities map to nearly the same value of $g_{m}/I_{D}$, so the $g_{m}/I_{D}$ is no longer a good proxy to design<br>
